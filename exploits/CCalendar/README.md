# CCalendar - Exploits

The Python files in this directory are scripts that exploit the different
vulnerabilities present in the service. They expect a team IP address as first
parameter and the flag ID in JSON format (as returned by the game system) as
second parameter.

Example invocation:

```sh
./CCalendar-1-static.py '10.11.12.13' '{"username": "example"}'
./CCalendar-1-user-injection.py '10.11.12.13' '{"username": "example"}'
./CCalendar-2-memcpy-bof.py '10.11.12.13' '{"username": "example", "date": "2024-12-31"}'
./CCalendar-2-snprintf-retval.py '10.11.12.13' '{"username": "example", "date": "2024-12-31"}'
```

Additionally, [`simple_attacker.py`](./simple_attacker.py) provides a simple
weaponization of the exploits to run them on multiple teams in parallel with
automatic flag submission.
